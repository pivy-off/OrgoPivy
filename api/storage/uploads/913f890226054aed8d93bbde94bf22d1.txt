ORGO TEST NOTES V1

Carbonyl basics
Aldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones toward nucleophilic addition because they have less steric hindrance and less electron donation.

Aldol reaction
Base removes an alpha hydrogen to form an enolate.
Enolate attacks a carbonyl to form a beta hydroxy carbonyl aldol addition product.
Aldol condensation happens when dehydration occurs often with heat to give an alpha beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Claisen condensation
Requires an ester with an alpha hydrogen.
Use an alkoxide base that matches the ester OR group to avoid transesterification.
After C C bond formation, the beta keto ester product is deprotonated then acid workup reprotonates.

Michael addition
A Michael donor is an enolate or other stabilized nucleophile.
A Michael acceptor is an alpha beta unsaturated carbonyl.
The nucleophile adds to the beta carbon 1,4 addition rather than 1,2 addition.

Nucleophilic acyl substitution
Acid chlorides are very reactive and can form esters or amides.
Leaving group ability matters Cl minus is a good leaving group.

Redox quick rules
NaBH4 reduces aldehydes and ketones to alcohols.
LiAlH4 reduces esters to primary alcohols.
PCC oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes without overoxidation.

Common traps
Choose base strength carefully strong bulky base can favor kinetic enolate.
Heat can push elimination or dehydration steps.
